        this isnt magic charlie its mathematicstthi is called multiplication in
        mathematics. if you will multiply the number of candies in one jar it
        will givewyou total candies in 3 jars. for that youll have to remembr
        how many candies in one to ten box.this is useless. if someon has
        alreaady told me values which i have mmorised its not even
        calculation.wgat thbe point of question. charlie i m trying to tachyou
        10 value.but if you remember these 10 values, you cn ven tell ho
        maaaaaany candies r there in twenty candies. ohh
