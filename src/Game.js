          <div>why did these things fall down.</div>a ball cannot move on its
          own.it rquires some pull or oush(show ball push or pull)so whta is
          happening here. is something pushing the ball towards the ground or
          somthing on ground is pulling it towards itself

          something like a magnet inside earth tht pulls evrything towrds
          <div>
